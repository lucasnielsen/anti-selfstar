# Anti Selfstar
A simple anti selfstar bot made for a server I'm in.

This is supposed to go work with [this](https://top.gg/bot/655390915325591629) bot.

## To run:
- Change everything in the script that needs changing: token, user IDs, etc.
- Install `discord.js` v14 and `Node.js` 20.
- Run `node index.js` in the project directory or something, idk

(note to self: i think you have to install other stuff too to register the slash commands and stuff i just forget what)
